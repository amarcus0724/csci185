1. What corrections did you have to make? I had to make some contrast edits. 

I had to make some contrast edits. I had to add labels to the forms. The pictures need alt text. 


1. Do you think your website is usable if you turn off the CSS? Why or why not? 

I dont think so. The layout would be hard to read and look at. I do think that contrast would be ok because everything would be in black and white 

1. Is your site is tabbable? In other words, without the use of the mouse, are all the links and buttons accessible using the tab key?

yes



Reminder: don't forget to include a screenshot of your Wave report and link to it from your homepage!
